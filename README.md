Virtual Mouse makes human computer interaction simple by making use of Hand Gestures. The computer requires almost no direct contact. All i/o operations can be virtually controlled by using static and dynamic hand gestures. This project makes use of the state-of-art Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to recognize hand gestures, which works smoothly without any additional hardware requirements. It leverages models such as CNN implemented by [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) running on top of pybind11. It consists of two modules: One which works direct on hands by making use of MediaPipe Hand detection. Currently it works on Windows platform.


### Procedure


Step 1: 
  ```bash
  conda create --name gest python=3.8.5
  ```
  
  Step 2:
  ```bash
  conda activate gest
  ```
  
  Step 3:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

 Step 4:
  Command may look like: `cd C:\Users\.....\Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse`

   Step 5:
  ```bash 
  python Gesture_Controller.py
  ```
